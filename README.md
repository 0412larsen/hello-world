# hello-world
This is mye first repository.

I'm Toni!

I want to become a front end developer and designer.
I struggle with committing 100% since get easily distracted.
If i try to stay realistic, not get water over my head and 
prioritize my time correctly I'll eventually learn what I need to get a job or start freelancing.
